 HTML components and in PDF documents. However, the tool is currently not
 available for exercises or video transcripts.

Students can access their notes either in the body of the course or on a
specific **Notes** tab. The **Notes** tab lists all the notes that students have
made during the course. It also contains links to the notes in the body of the
course.
