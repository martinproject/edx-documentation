Your edX course may include student notes, a feature that you can use to
highlight and make notes about what you read during your course. Student
notes allow you to record your thoughts about course content right in the body
of the course. If you leave a page and come back to it later, you can still see
your note on the page.

You can also access a tab that lists all the notes you've made during the
course. This tab contains links to your notes in the body of the course.

 videos.

Using Student Notes
***************************

===================
Show or Hide Notes
===================

If student notes are available in your course, you see a pencil icon in the
lower-right corner of each page. By default, this option is selected, and you
can see any notes that you make.

If you don't want to see your highlights or notes in the course, select the
pencil icon to turn off student notes. You can always select the icon again if
you want to see your notes.

.. note:: If you turn off student notes, you cannot see any of the notes 
 that you have made in the course. You also cannot create new notes while the
 feature is turned off.

On the **Notes** tab, you can see all the notes you've created in your course in

On the **Notes** tab, you can see both the text that you selected and the note
that you added. In the right pane, you can also see the location of the text and
your note in the course. This pane contains a link to the unit where you created
your note. To see your note in the body of the course, click the link for that
note.
